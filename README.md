# Readable Project
This project was developed using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The goal of this project is to build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## TL;DR

To launch the project on your machine:

* make sure you have installed node8+
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the api server and the development server with `npm start`
